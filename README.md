> "When in doubt, write a small test application"

A series of small programs, designed to trying out some interesting idea or
demonstating a concept. Some of these may be good ideas, some of them may be
proven to be quite the opposite.

Licenced under an MIT licence - not really intended for use as a library, but
perhaps some of this code might serve use to someone somewhere.
